## Household Survey Analysis

# Introduction

Sylhet district has been lagging behind many other districts with respect to maternal-newborn health (MNH) and family planning (FP)
services. The Mamota project is being implementing in five Upazilas of the Sylhet district for ensuring quality healthcare services for
pregnant women and the newborn including family planning services. The baseline study intends to generate baseline value of the concerned indicators for understanding of the present situation of MNH‐FP services as well as for monitoring and evaluation of the project.

# Research Design

The baseline study has used both quantitative and qualitative methods for collecting necessary data and information from the targeted
respondents and stakeholders. The quantitative data regarding maternal, newborn health and family planning have mainly been collected
from selected households covering two kinds of respondents - mothers with a child aged less than 1 year and currently married women aged
15-49 years who are not pregnant or not given any birth during one year prior to the survey. On the other hand, the qualitative survey
have been conducted covering the community decision makers, health professionals and other stakeholders. Finally, the study adopted the
following techniques for collecting the necessary data and information:  

•	Household-level survey
•	Focus Group Discussions (FGD)
•	Key Informant's Interview (KII)
•	In-depth Interviews (IDI)
•	Secondary data analysis

The study designs for quantitative and qualitative methods are categorically discussed below:

# Quantitative Methods 

A number of the baseline indicators, viz.,  antenatal care (ANC), postnatal care (PNC), Facility Delivery, delivery at home with skilled
birth attendance (SBA), knowledge on danger signs during pregnancy and delivery, knowledge on danger signs for newborn, contraceptive
use rate, and method of contraception have been estimated through household-level survey. The other two quantitative indicators, viz.,
Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) and Neonatal Mortality Rate (NMR) is gathered from different secondary sources including recently
conducted Bangladesh Maternal Mortality and Health Care Survey (BMMS) 2016. 

For sampling purposes of the quantitative household-level survey, the targeted respondents can be categorized as:
(a) Women who has given birth within one year prior to the survey, that is, mothers with a child aged one year or less for covering the
information of ANC, PNC, facility delivery, and SBA delivery at home.
(b) Married women of reproductive age who are not pregnant at the survey point or not given any birth during the last 1 year for
covering the information of contraceptive use and family planning related indicators

# Sample Design

Sampling technique and sample size estimation are the key activities undertaken while designing any research study. An adequate estimate
(not less and not more) of sample size is important for ethical, scientific and logistic reasons. The units of analysis for the
quantitative survey are two distinct type of households, because two types of respondents as stated above have to cover for estimating
two different types (MNH and FP) of indicators. Therefore, the sample size needs to be estimate separately for two types of respondents.
The study has adopted cluster sampling technique, in which the Union Parishads (UP) is considered as clusters. 
For covering the required respondents categorized above as (a) Women/mothers who has given birth within one year prior to the survey,
and (b) Married women of reproductive age who are not pregnant at the survey point or not given any birth during the last 1 year, the
recognized sample size determination formula  [on the basis of 50% indicator percentage (proportion of women received ANC), 95%
confidence interval, 0.05 error margin and highest response distribution with an assumed design effect 1.85] yields that about 710
targeted households are required to cover for each category of respondents. The study collected information covering 15 clusters from
the targeted intervention unions. These 15 clusters have been selected via proportional allocation. For rounded up and distributed in 15
clusters, the sample size increases to 720. Thus, the total sample size for household-level survey stands 1440 (720 × 2) sample
households for covering two types of respondents.
